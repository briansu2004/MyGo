# Go Naming Conventions

In Go, there are certain conventions followed for naming identifiers, including variables, constants, functions, types, and packages. Here are some of the key conventions:

1. **Package Names**: Package names should be short, concise, and lowercase. Avoid underscores or hyphens in package names. If it's a multi-word name, use camelCase. For example: `package main` or `package mypackage`.

2. **File Names**: Go source files should be named after the package they contain. Use lowercase letters for file names, and avoid underscores or hyphens. For example, a file containing the `myPackage` package should be named `mypackage.go`.

3. **Exported Names**: Names that begin with an uppercase letter are exported from the package and can be accessed by other packages. Names starting with a lowercase letter are not exported (private to the package). For example:
   - `var MyVariable int` (exported)
   - `var myVariable int` (not exported)

4. **Function Names**: Function names should be concise and meaningful. Use camelCase for multi-word function names. Public functions should have capitalized names. For example:
   - `func CalculateTotal()`
   - `func myFunction()`

5. **Variable Names**: Variable names should also be concise and meaningful. Use camelCase for multi-word variable names. For example:
   - `var myVariable int`
   - `var totalAmount float64`

6. **Constant Names**: Constants should be in uppercase letters. Use underscores to separate words in constant names. For example:
   - `const MaxSize = 100`
   - `const PI = 3.14`

7. **Type Names**: Type names should be concise and follow the same conventions as variable names. Use camelCase for multi-word type names. For example:
   - `type MyStruct struct{}`
   - `type MyInterface interface{}`

8. **Acronyms**: For acronyms, use all uppercase for two-letter acronyms, and capitalize only the first letter for longer acronyms. For example:
   - `HTTPServer`
   - `xmlDecoder`

Following these conventions ensures that your code remains readable and consistent, which is crucial for collaboration and maintenance.
