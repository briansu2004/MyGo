## My Go Projects

### 2: Developed end-to-end solutions for managing Dask Kubernetes Clusters, leveraging Full Stack REST APIs and VUE applications deployed on Azure

- Engineered RESTful APIs using Golang for efficient cluster management, ensuring robust functionality and scalability.
- Containerized backend APIs and UI applications using Docker, enabling seamless deployment and scalability.
- Orchestrated deployment processes using Azure ACR repository and Azure AKS, ensuring efficient management and scaling of resources.
Exposed APIs securely to the public internet through Azure AKS, ensuring accessibility while maintaining security standards.

<!-- ### 2: Created Full Stack REST APIs (backend) and VUE (front-end) apps to manage Dask Kubernetes Clusters and deployed to Azure

- Coded the functions to manage Dask Kubernetes Clusters with GoLang and Python.
- Monitored the Clusters with Kubectl and dashboard.
- Programmed REST APIs with GoLang.
- Built the UI with VUE and Vuetify.
- Containerized the backend API app and UI app with Docker, managed with Azure ACR repository, deployed to Azure AKS and then exposed the API to a public IP. -->

<!-- ### 1: Designed and implemented Cloud functions and CI/CD data pipelines in Google Cloud for a large multinational company

- Programmed cloud functions in Golang and Python.
- Configured one cloud function to monitor incoming Pub/Sub messages then save to BigQuery, another cloud function to archive data from BigQuery to GCS bucket in avro format with Cloud Schedule.
- Created unit tests with go mock framework and integration tests for test coverage.
- Built a stress testing multi-threading tool for performance benchmark and adjusted Cloud Function configuration.
- Managed all GCP infrastructure as code with Terraform scripts, parameterized all cloud functions, automated everything and enabled auto-scaling.
- Designed and built the CI/CD pipelines with Cloud Source Repository, Cloud Build and GCP Container Registry with Docker and YAML; set up the triggers for the test pipelines and prod pipeline; configured multiple test pipelines can run concurrently.
- Handed over high quality detailed runbook documentation. -->

### 1: Led the design and implementation of Cloud Functions and CI/CD data pipelines in Google Cloud for a large multinational company

- Developed and programmed two robust cloud functions in Golang to automate critical processes: Configured one cloud function to monitor incoming Pub/Sub messages and seamlessly integrate them into BigQuery for real-time data analysis; Engineered another cloud function to efficiently archive data from BigQuery to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket in Avro format using Cloud Schedule, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests with gomock and integration tests with testify to ensure the reliability and robustness of Golang codebase.
- Engineered a stress testing multi-threading tool to benchmark performance and fine-tune Cloud Function configurations for optimal scalability and efficiency.
- Managed all GCP infrastructure as code using Terraform scripts, enabling seamless deployment, scaling, and management of cloud resources. Parameterized all cloud functions for flexibility and automation.
- Architected and built CI/CD pipelines utilizing Cloud Source Repository, Cloud Build, and GCP Container Registry with Docker and YAML configurations.
- Configured triggers for test pipelines and production pipeline, ensuring seamless integration and continuous delivery of code changes.
- Implemented concurrent test pipelines for improved efficiency and faster feedback loops.-
