## My Go Projects

### My Go Project #2

Developed end-to-end solutions for managing Dask Kubernetes Clusters, leveraging Full Stack REST APIs and VUE applications deployed on Azure

- Engineered RESTful APIs using Golang for efficient cluster management, ensuring robust functionality and scalability.
- Containerized backend APIs and UI applications using Docker, enabling seamless deployment and scalability.
- Orchestrated deployment processes using Azure ACR repository and Azure AKS, ensuring efficient management and scaling of resources.
Exposed APIs securely to the public internet through Azure AKS, ensuring accessibility while maintaining security standards.

<!-- ### 2: Created Full Stack REST APIs (backend) and VUE (front-end) apps to manage Dask Kubernetes Clusters and deployed to Azure

- Coded the functions to manage Dask Kubernetes Clusters with GoLang and Python.
- Monitored the Clusters with Kubectl and dashboard.
- Programmed REST APIs with GoLang.
- Built the UI with VUE and Vuetify.
- Containerized the backend API app and UI app with Docker, managed with Azure ACR repository, deployed to Azure AKS and then exposed the API to a public IP. -->

<!-- ### 1: Designed and implemented Cloud functions and CI/CD data pipelines in Google Cloud for a large multinational company

- Programmed cloud functions in Golang and Python.
- Configured one cloud function to monitor incoming Pub/Sub messages then save to BigQuery, another cloud function to archive data from BigQuery to GCS bucket in avro format with Cloud Schedule.
- Created unit tests with go mock framework and integration tests for test coverage.
- Built a stress testing multi-threading tool for performance benchmark and adjusted Cloud Function configuration.
- Managed all GCP infrastructure as code with Terraform scripts, parameterized all cloud functions, automated everything and enabled auto-scaling.
- Designed and built the CI/CD pipelines with Cloud Source Repository, Cloud Build and GCP Container Registry with Docker and YAML; set up the triggers for the test pipelines and prod pipeline; configured multiple test pipelines can run concurrently.
- Handed over high quality detailed runbook documentation. -->

### My Go Project #1

Led the design and implementation of Cloud Functions and CI/CD data pipelines in Google Cloud for a large multinational company

- Developed and programmed two robust cloud functions in Golang to automate critical processes: Configured one cloud function to monitor incoming Pub/Sub messages and seamlessly integrate them into BigQuery for real-time data analysis; Engineered another cloud function to efficiently archive data from BigQuery to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket in Avro format using Cloud Schedule, ensuring data integrity and accessibility.
- Implemented comprehensive unit tests with gomock and integration tests with testify to ensure the reliability and robustness of Golang codebase.
- Engineered a stress testing multi-threading tool to benchmark performance and fine-tune Cloud Function configurations for optimal scalability and efficiency.
- Managed all GCP infrastructure as code using Terraform scripts, enabling seamless deployment, scaling, and management of cloud resources. Parameterized all cloud functions for flexibility and automation.
- Architected and built CI/CD pipelines utilizing Cloud Source Repository, Cloud Build, and GCP Container Registry with Docker and YAML configurations.
- Configured triggers for test pipelines and production pipeline, ensuring seamless integration and continuous delivery of code changes.
- Implemented concurrent test pipelines for improved efficiency and faster feedback loops.-

### Galvanize A Go REST API App


<!-- Data Processing Tool: You can create a Go application for processing large datasets, such as CSV files, JSON files, or database records. This could involve tasks like data cleaning, transformation, analysis, or visualization.

Command-Line Tool: Develop a command-line interface (CLI) application in Go for performing various tasks, such as file manipulation, system monitoring, text processing, or network operations. CLI tools are versatile and can be very useful for automation and scripting.

Real-Time Chat Application: Build a real-time chat application using Go and websockets. This could involve creating a server to handle incoming connections and messages, as well as a frontend interface for users to send and receive messages in real-time.

Image Processing Tool: Develop an image processing application in Go for tasks like resizing, cropping, filtering, or applying various effects to images. You can utilize existing Go libraries like goimaging or primitive for this purpose.

Authentication Service: Create an authentication service using Go and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization. This could involve features like user registration, login, logout, password reset, and managing user roles.

Task Scheduler: Build a task scheduling application in Go for executing tasks or jobs at specified intervals or times. This could be useful for automating repetitive tasks, performing backups, or triggering certain actions based on specific events.

Content Management System (CMS): Develop a lightweight content management system using Go and a database like MySQL or PostgreSQL. This could involve features like creating, editing, and deleting content, user management, and role-based access control.

File Sharing Service: Create a file sharing service using Go and HTTP or FTP for uploading and downloading files securely. You can implement features like user authentication, file encryption, access control, and expiration dates for shared files.

Geolocation Service: Build a geolocation service in Go for converting IP addresses to geographical locations or performing reverse geocoding (converting coordinates to addresses). You can integrate with third-party APIs like MaxMind or GeoNames for this purpose.

Inventory Management System: Develop an inventory management system using Go for tracking and managing inventory items, orders, shipments, and suppliers. This could include features like barcode scanning, inventory alerts, and reporting capabilities.

These are just a few ideas to get you started. Depending on your interests and requirements, you can explore various domains and come up with unique applications to build using Go. -->
